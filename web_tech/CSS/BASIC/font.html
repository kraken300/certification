        The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous
        mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology and genetics have
        shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet
        and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for companionship
        and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey such as mice and
        rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell
        are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication
        includes vocalizations—including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting—as well as body
        language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small
        mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
