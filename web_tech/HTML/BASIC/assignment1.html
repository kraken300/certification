        <h1 id="food">Food</h1>
        <p>
            Food is any substance consumed by an organism for nutritional support. Food is usually of plant, animal, or
            fungal origin and contains essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals.
            The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain
            life, or stimulate growth. Different species of animals have different feeding behaviours that satisfy the
            needs of their metabolisms and have evolved to fill a specific ecological niche within specific geographical
            contexts.

            Omnivorous humans are highly adaptable and have adapted to obtain food in many different ecosystems. Humans
            generally use cooking to prepare food for consumption. The majority of the food energy required is supplied
            by the industrial food industry, which produces food through intensive agriculture and distributes it
            through complex food processing and food distribution systems. This system of conventional agriculture
            relies heavily on fossil fuels, which means that the food and agricultural systems are one of the major
            contributors to climate change, accounting for as much as 37% of total greenhouse gas emissions.[1]

            The food system has significant impacts on a wide range of other social and political issues, including
            sustainability, biological diversity, economics, population growth, water supply, and food security. Food
            safety and security are monitored by international agencies like the International Association for Food
            Protection, the World Resources Institute, the World Food Programme, the Food and Agriculture Organization,
            and the International Food Information Council.

        <h1 id="clothing">Clothing</h1>
        <p>
            Clothing (also known as clothes, garments, dress, apparel, or attire) is any item worn on the body.
            Typically, clothing is made of fabrics or textiles, but over time it has included garments made from animal
            skin and other thin sheets of materials and natural products found in the environment, put together. The
            wearing of clothing is mostly restricted to human beings and is a feature of all human societies. The amount
            and type of clothing worn depends on gender, body type, social factors, and geographic considerations.
            Garments cover the body, footwear covers the feet, gloves cover the hands, while hats and headgear cover the
            head, and underwear covers the private parts.

            Clothing serves many purposes: it can serve as protection from the elements, rough surfaces, sharp stones,
            rash-causing plants, and insect bites, by providing a barrier between the skin and the environment. Clothing
            can insulate against cold or hot conditions, and it can provide a hygienic barrier, keeping infectious and
            toxic materials away from the body. It can protect feet from injury and discomfort or facilitate navigation
            in varied environments. Clothing also provides protection from ultraviolet radiation. It may be used to
            prevent glare or increase visual acuity in harsh environments, such as brimmed hats. Clothing is used for
            protection against injury in specific tasks and occupations, sports, and warfare. Fashioned with pockets,
            belts, or loops, clothing may provide a means to carry things while freeing the hands.

            Clothing has significant social factors as well. Wearing clothes is a variable social norm. It may connote
            modesty. Being deprived of clothing in front of others may be embarrassing. In many parts of the world, not
            wearing clothes in public so that genitals, breast, or buttocks are visible could be considered indecent
            exposure. Pubic area or genital coverage is the most frequently encountered minimum found cross-culturally
            and regardless of climate, implying social convention as the basis of customs. Clothing also may be used to
            communicate social status, wealth, group identity, and individualism.

        <h1 id="game">Game</h1>
        <p>
            A game is a structured type of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an
            educational tool.[1] Many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator
            sports or games) or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as mahjong,
            solitaire, or some video games).

            Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. They can be
            played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an audience of
            non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. On the other hand,
            players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the
            entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player. A
            toy and a game are not the same. Toys generally allow for unrestricted play whereas games present rules for
            the player to follow.

            Key components of games are goals, rules, challenge, and interaction. Games generally involve mental or
            physical stimulation, and often both. Many games help develop practical skills, serve as a form of exercise,
            or otherwise perform an educational, simulational, or psychological role.

        <h1 id="smartphone">Smartphone</h1>
        <p>
            A smartphone, often simply called a phone, is a mobile device that combines the functionality of a
            traditional mobile phone with advanced computing capabilities. It typically has a touchscreen interface,
            allowing users to access a wide range of applications and services, such as web browsing, email, and social
            media, as well as multimedia playback and streaming. Smartphones have built-in cameras, GPS navigation, and
            support for various communication methods, including voice calls, text messaging, and internet-based
            messaging apps.

            Smartphones are distinguished from older-design feature phones by their more advanced hardware capabilities
            and extensive mobile operating systems, access to the internet, business applications, mobile payments, and
            multimedia functionality, including music, video, gaming, radio, and television.

        <h1 id="electronics">Electronics</h1>
        <p>
            Electronics is a scientific and engineering discipline that studies and applies the principles of physics to
            design, create, and operate devices that manipulate electrons and other electrically charged particles. It
            is a subfield of physics[1][2] and electrical engineering which uses active devices such as transistors,
            diodes, and integrated circuits to control and amplify the flow of electric current and to convert it from
            one form to another, such as from alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC) or from analog signals to
            digital signals.

            Electronic devices have hugely influenced the development of many aspects of modern society, such as
            telecommunications, entertainment, education, health care, industry, and security. The main driving force
            behind the advancement of electronics is the semiconductor industry, which in response to global demand
            continually produces ever-more sophisticated electronic devices and circuits. The semiconductor industry is
            one of the largest and most profitable sectors in the global economy, with annual revenues exceeding $481
            billion in 2018. The electronics industry also encompasses other sectors that rely on electronic devices and
            systems, such as e-commerce, which generated over $29 trillion in online sales in 2017.

        <h1 id="furniture">Furniture</h1>
        <p>
            Furniture refers to objects intended to support various human activities such as seating (e.g., stools,
            chairs, and sofas), eating (tables), storing items, working, and sleeping (e.g., beds and hammocks).
            Furniture is also used to hold objects at a convenient height for work (as horizontal surfaces above the
            ground, such as tables and desks), or to store things (e.g., cupboards, shelves, and drawers). Furniture can
            be a product of design and can be considered a form of decorative art. In addition to furniture's functional
            role, it can serve a symbolic or religious purpose. It can be made from a vast multitude of materials,
            including metal, plastic, and wood. Furniture can be made using a variety of woodworking joints which often
            reflects the local culture.

            People have been using natural objects, such as tree stumps, rocks and moss, as furniture since the
            beginning of human civilization and continues today in some households/campsites. Archaeological research
            shows that from around 30,000 years ago, people started to construct and carve their own furniture, using
            wood, stone, and animal bones. Early furniture from this period is known from artwork such as a Venus
            figurine found in Russia, depicting the goddess on a throne. The first surviving extant furniture is in the
            homes of Skara Brae in Scotland, and includes cupboards, dressers and beds all constructed from stone.
            Complex construction techniques such as joinery began in the early dynastic period of ancient Egypt.
